# Weather Dashboard 

## Description

This project for challenge 6 of the UT Austin Full-stack coding bootcamp provided the opportunity to practice fetching API data and saving/rendering information from local storage. Once complete, the app will allow users to search for a city and see current and 5 day forecasted weather conditions. 



## Usage

To use the application, search for a city name to see it populate on the screen. Once more features are completed the search results will also return weather forecast information.
