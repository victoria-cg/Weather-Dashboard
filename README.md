# Weather Dashboard 

## Description

This project for challenge 6 of the UT Austin Full-stack coding bootcamp provided the opportunity to practice fetching API data and saving/rendering information from local storage. It allows the user to render weather information from searched cities using a weather API, and previously searched cities are populated to the screen.



## Usage

To use the application, search for a city name to see its weather populate on the screen.
The website can be accessed at the following URL: https://victoria-cg.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/

Collaboration/Assistance:

Tutoring with Alexis Gonzalez: 
-use of and syntax dynamically insert data, debugging
-order and syntax of functions to set, parse, and push local storage items
-use of card to display information
-changed html div classes to IDs for easier JS manipulation
-clearing weather text on cards/forecast with an empty string: debugging to clear previous forecast on refresh

Office Hours with Walter Perry:
-Assistance with order of API calls and how to find the information on the weather API for coding the icons to display the forecast.
-Assisted with debugging attempts for API call on stored city names/buttons

Ask BCS tutor:
-Helped with debugging syntax for appending information accurately from an array returned by API for weather data
-Helped with debugging rendering of functions for setting to storage/retrieving storage


AI Xpert:

-Helped with debugging function scope with regard to items inside for loop not functioning as intended
